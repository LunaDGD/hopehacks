##Pollution.com

Pollution.com is a website that gives user info about air pollution. The goal of the website is to spread awareness and provide alternative solutions
to reuduce air pollution. We created a single page website to provide a seamless experience for the users. The site shows the problems air pollution has on
humans anad our environment. The site is also connected to a thrird-party api called Map Web Service:Real-time Air Quality Tile API, that includes the
real-time Air Quality data onto the map. The map displays colored tiles that correspond to different air qualitiy levels. The colors range from green
to dark red. Green means good air quality and dark red means hazardous air quality. Next, we provide alternative solutions to the problems we mentioned
earlier in the site. In addition to this, we created a first-party api that allows the user click on three cities, Charlotte, Atlanta, and Richmond.
When clicked it will provide links to public transportation in the specified city. Lastly, we added a contact form that takes the users input
and connects it to a SQL database.

###How does it work?
Open up your browser on a new page and visit https://hopehacks-group9.herokuapp.com/

and scroll to different cities around the world.
